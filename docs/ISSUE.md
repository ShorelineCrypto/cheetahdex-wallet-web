## Priorities

`P0` label indicates critical bug, regression or failure, usually in production or in a release candidate. It means the assigned developer should **stop working on all current tasks** and focus on `P0` until it's fixed/resolved. Normally there should be zero open `P0` bugs.

`P1` indicates crucial bug or feature, **blocking current sprint release**. No new tasks should be started until `P1` resolved.

`P2` indicates important problem that we want to resolve as soon as possible.

`P3` indicates a time-permitted task: minor/rare bug, non-critical request, research, documentation update, ongoing discussion etc.
